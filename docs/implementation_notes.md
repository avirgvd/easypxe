HPE iLO give RAID drives information from ArrayControllers endpoint: 
`/redfish/v1/Systems/1/SmartStorage/ArrayControllers`

The output includes LogicalDrives information which includes a property "**VolumeUniqueIdentifier**" which matches with the drive IDs listed by ESXi and Redhat.

For Linux, it matches with SERIAL number field from the below command:
`lsblk -o SERIAL,NAME |grep -i '%DRIVEID%'`

And for ESXi, it is listed by the following command:
`localcli storage core device list`

And the drive ID matches the desired device when following Kickstart command is used:
`install --drive=naa.%DRIVEID% --overwritevmfs`

Where as for Dell, its not the same. 
iDRAC Redfish interface doesnt give any unique ID 
that matches with serial numbers listed by the OS. 
Not sure if this is limitation of storage 
controller "PERC H710 Adapter" used in the lab system 
or is this limitation on iDRAC to include unique ID 
generated by the storage adaptor.

xorriso can both extract and generate the ISO files. Explore using this in place of genisoimage. 
First check if there are any security vulnerabilities. 
If it uses FUSE IO then rule it out as FUSE drivers have serious security holes.
